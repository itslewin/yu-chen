Yu Chen Hsu is a Taiwanese photographer based in Berlin.

With a cinematic approach, Yuâ€™s photography is a blend of poetry and melancholy, where light and shadow reveal the subtle emotions and unspoken stories of people and places.

Through thoughtful composition and a deep connection to the subject, Yu's images invite viewers into a world of contemplation, where reality meets a delicate, almost dreamlike, narrative.
